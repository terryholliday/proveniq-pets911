CHAPTER 19. AGRICULTURE.
ARTICLE 36. BREEDER ACCOUNTABILITY AND REGULATION FOR KINDNESS ACT.
§19-36-1. Short title.
This article may be cited as the "Breeder Accountability and Regulation for Kindness Act" or the "BARK Act".
§19-36-2. Legislative findings and purpose.
The Legislature hereby finds and declares:
(a) The health and welfare of dogs bred and sold within this state is a matter of significant public concern, affecting animal welfare, public health, consumer protection, and the economic interests of responsible breeders.
(b) Unregulated large-scale commercial breeding operations contribute to animal suffering, genetic health problems in dogs, deceptive sales practices, and the abandonment of animals that ultimately burden public shelters and rescue organizations.
(c) Existing regulatory frameworks, including §19-20-26 of this code, have proven insufficient to address these concerns due to inadequate licensing requirements, limited enforcement capacity, and loopholes that allow harmful breeding practices to continue.
(d) A comprehensive regulatory approach that includes universal breeder licensing, enforceable operational standards, scale limitations, consumer protections, and adequate enforcement mechanisms is necessary to protect animal welfare, consumers, and the integrity of responsible breeding practices.
(e) Self-funding enforcement through license fees and civil penalties ensures sustainable regulatory capacity without burdening general taxpayers.
(f) Dogs bred in other states and sold to West Virginia consumers are frequently subject to inadequate welfare oversight in the state of origin, creating competitive disadvantage for compliant in-state breeders and imposing externalized costs on West Virginia shelters, veterinary systems, and purchasers. Regulation of interstate sales to West Virginia consumers serves legitimate local interests in consumer protection, animal welfare, and public health that cannot be adequately addressed by the exporting state.
(g) The inadequate identification and tracking of stray and impounded animals, combined with outdated notification mechanisms that predate modern communication technology, has resulted in unnecessary animal deaths and failure to reunite lost pets with their owners.
(h) Citizens who assist stray animals in good faith often face unintended legal consequences, including being deemed owners or harborers under outdated ordinances, which discourages community involvement in lost pet recovery.
(i) Continuous tethering and chaining of dogs causes physical injury, psychological distress, and behavioral problems, and is associated with increased aggression and dog bite incidents.
(j) Rural counties in this state often lack the resources to operate dedicated animal control facilities, and regional cooperation through joint authorities offers a proven model for efficient service delivery.

§19-36-12. Statewide breeder limitation; workload-based capacity.
(a) The department shall establish a maximum number of breeder licenses that may be issued statewide, based on the department's capacity to conduct meaningful inspections and enforcement.
(b) Capacity calculation. — The department shall limit license issuance such that the total projected workload units required for all licensees does not exceed eighty percent of the department's total available inspector hours. The department may not increase total committed workload units above ninety percent of available inspector hours nor decrease below sixty percent except by legislative rule. Weights assigned to tiers may be altered only by legislative rule with a published impact analysis. Until a legislative rule establishes an alternative methodology:
(1) Tier 1 licenses shall be assigned five workload units;
(2) Tier 2 licenses shall be assigned ten workload units;

(i) Inspection-time accounting. — Available inspector hours shall be calculated from actual duty time, with carve-outs for leave, training, administrative duties, and travel time disclosed in the capacity workbook. The department shall annually publish the methodology used to calculate available hours, including the percentage of time allocated to inspections versus other duties.
(j) Audit trigger. — If the actual inspection completion rate falls below eighty percent of scheduled inspections for two consecutive quarters, the commissioner shall within thirty days publish a corrective staffing plan or temporarily reduce new license issuance until completion rates recover. The corrective plan shall be reported to the advisory committee.
§19-36-13. Anti-evasion provisions.
(a) It is unlawful to structure breeding operations, form multiple business entities, use nominees or agents, or otherwise attempt to circumvent the per-operation or statewide limitations established by this article.
(b) The department may aggregate the breeding dogs of related operations that it determines are operated under common control for purposes of calculating compliance with scale limitations.
(c) Operations shall be presumed to be under common control if they share two or more of the indicia listed in §19-36-3(f) of this code. The presumption may be rebutted by clear and convincing evidence of independent operation.
(d) A person who knowingly structures operations to evade the limitations of this article is guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be fined not less than $5,000 nor more than $25,000.
(e) Anti-rotation. — It is unlawful to rotate intact dogs between licenses or households under common control for the purpose or effect of avoiding headcount or inspection frequency limits. Any dog present at two or more licensed premises under common control within any twelve-month period counts toward the headcount of each operation for that period. Lease, lend, foster-in-name-only, or similar instruments designed to redistribute headcount are deemed rotations for purposes of this subsection.
(f) Anti-rotation exceptions. — Subsection (e) of this section does not apply to:
(1) Temporary transfer for veterinary treatment, hospitalization, or surgery at a licensed veterinary facility;
(2) Emergency evacuation due to fire, flood, natural disaster, or other emergency declared by a government authority;
(3) Lawful transport by a registered transporter consistent with §19-36-21 of this code;
(4) Transfer to a buyer upon completion of sale; or

§19-36-14. Mandatory inspections; documentation; evidence pack.
(a) All licensed breeding operations are subject to inspection by the department.
(b) The department shall conduct:
(1) An initial inspection within sixty days of license issuance;
(2) At least one unannounced inspection annually for Tier 1 licensees;
(3) At least two unannounced inspections annually for Tier 2 licensees;
(4) At least four unannounced inspections annually for Tier 3 licensees and variance holders; and
(5) Additional inspections as warranted by complaints, prior violations, or other circumstances.
(c) Inspections shall be conducted during reasonable hours without prior notice to the licensee.
(d) Refusal to permit inspection is grounds for immediate license suspension pursuant to §19-36-10(b) of this code.
(e) Documentation and evidence pack. — Inspection findings shall be documented using a standardized evidence pack including: chain-of-custody log; date and time-stamped, geo-tagged digital photographs or video; thermometer and hygrometer readings; space and enrichment calculations; headcount attestation; a standardized checklist citing each applicable standard; any on-site corrective orders issued; and signed witness statements where applicable. The department shall retain inspection media and documentation for at least five years. Findings shall be entered into the public registry established in §19-36-41 of this code. Evidence packs may be admitted as business records upon certification by the custodian or inspector consistent with the rules of evidence; weight and credibility remain for the trier of fact.
(f) Administrative inspection warrant. — If a licensee refuses to consent to an inspection, the department may apply to the circuit court or magistrate for an administrative inspection warrant upon a showing that the inspection is authorized by law and is conducted pursuant to a neutral inspection scheme. Refusal to permit inspection pending warrant issuance shall not independently trigger suspension. Continued refusal after service of a valid warrant is grounds for immediate license suspension and is a serious violation.
(g) Inspection grades. — Following each inspection, the department shall issue an inspection grade of A, B, C, or D based on criteria established by legislative rule, reflecting the operation's overall compliance with the standards of this article.
(h) Grade posting. — The current inspection grade, inspection date, and summary of findings shall appear on the public registry and shall be posted conspicuously at each licensed premises entrance.
(i) Reinspection. — A grade of D triggers a mandatory reinspection within thirty days. Failure to achieve a grade of C or higher on reinspection is grounds for license suspension.
(j) Behavioral assessment. — The department shall utilize a standardized behavioral assessment protocol during inspections to evaluate animal welfare outcomes using a three-tier classification: Green (friendly, approaches readily, solicits interaction); Yellow (neutral or hesitant, neither approaches nor avoids); and Red (fearful, avoids contact, or displays aggression). For the first two years following the effective date of this article, behavioral assessments shall be used for data collection, licensee education, and program evaluation only, and shall not constitute an independent basis for license suspension unless the observed behavior indicates severe cruelty or neglect actionable under §61-8-19 of this code.
(k) Assessment sampling. — Behavioral assessment shall be conducted on all adult breeding dogs present during the inspection, or on a statistically valid random sample of at least twenty dogs or fifty percent of adult breeding dogs, whichever is greater, if the facility houses more than forty adult breeding dogs. The department shall establish sampling protocols by rule to prevent manipulation of assessment results.
(l) Corrective action. — Beginning in the third year following the effective date, if more than twenty-five percent of adult breeding dogs at any Tier 2 or Tier 3 facility are classified Red at any inspection, the department shall require a corrective action plan within fourteen days, including enrichment modifications, staffing adjustments, and reassessment within sixty days. A second failure to meet corrective thresholds within twelve months is grounds for civil penalties and license suspension.
(m) Inspector training. — The department shall train and certify inspectors in standardized assessment protocols, evidence capture techniques, biosecurity procedures, and humane animal handling. Inspectors shall complete annual refresher training. The department may contract with academic institutions or professional organizations to develop and deliver training programs.
(n) Digital evidence. — In any administrative or criminal proceeding under this article: (1) screenshots, printouts, or digital captures of online advertisements, social media posts, or electronic communications are admissible if accompanied by a certification stating the date, time, URL or platform, and method of capture; (2) metadata embedded in digital photographs or documents may be admitted as evidence of the date, time, and location of creation; (3) the department may designate trained personnel to conduct digital evidence collection using forensically sound methods; and (4) evidence collected from publicly accessible websites or platforms does not require a warrant.
(o) Enforcement priorities. — When inspection demand exceeds available capacity, the department shall prioritize: (1) complaints alleging imminent harm to animal health or safety; (2) Tier 3 operations and variance holders; (3) operations with prior serious or egregious violations; (4) new license applicants pending first inspection; (5) routine inspections of Tier 2 operations; and (6) routine inspections of Tier 1 operations. The department shall publish prioritization metrics in the annual report.
§19-36-15. Housing and care standards.
All breeding operations shall comply with the following minimum standards:
(a) Housing. — Dogs shall be provided with sufficient space to stand, turn, lie down, and stretch fully without obstruction. Primary enclosures shall provide at least twelve square feet per dog under twenty-five pounds, eighteen square feet per dog between twenty-five and fifty pounds, and twenty-four square feet per dog over fifty pounds, plus an additional fifty percent for each additional dog housed in the same enclosure.

(2) Any observed behavioral concerns, sensitivities, or triggers; and
(3) Recommendations for continued socialization appropriate to the puppy's age and developmental stage.
Failure to disclose known behavioral concerns that materially affect the dog's suitability as a companion is a violation of §19-36-43 of this code and triggers buyer remedies under §19-36-23 of this code.
§19-36-20. Advertising, location restrictions, and marketplace requirements.

(2) A pre-arranged transfer between a licensed breeder and a specific purchaser conducted at a designated safe exchange zone located at a law enforcement facility or other public location with video surveillance, provided the breeder retains documentation of the location and transaction.
A violation of this subsection is a serious violation under §19-36-22(c) of this code and authorizes immediate issuance of a stop-work order under §19-36-10(e) of this code.
(h) Out-of-state sellers; jurisdiction. — A person located outside this state who offers or transfers a dog to a West Virginia consumer is subject to this article and, by engaging in such offer or transfer, appoints the Secretary of State as agent for service of process for matters arising under this article.

NOTE: The purpose of this bill is to establish comprehensive canine welfare reform in West Virginia through the Breeder Accountability and Regulation for Kindness (BARK) Act. The bill classifies dogs as companion animals entitled to enhanced welfare protections while preserving property rights and agricultural classifications for working dogs. Key definitions include critical socialization period (three to fourteen weeks), flooding (forced stimulus exposure without retreat), positive human interaction (planned, non-aversive engagement distinct from routine husbandry), socialization (biosecurity-safe exposure to novel stimuli), at large, finder, harboring (fourteen or more consecutive days), impoundment, intake scanning, joint authority, and tethering. It requires all breeders to obtain a license from the Department of Agriculture, with a one-time accidental litter registration alternative available for a single accidental litter per person, per residence; the dam must be spayed within thirty days of last puppy transfer. Leased or borrowed dogs count toward headcount limits, and any dog present for fourteen days in any sixty-day period is deemed a breeding dog, unless kept solely for boarding under a written contract with no breeding rights. License numbers must be displayed at premises entrances and housing facilities. The commissioner may issue stop-work orders halting breeding activities when imminent risk exists, with hearings before the commissioner within five business days. Administrative appeals must be heard within thirty days with decisions within thirty days of close of record. The bill establishes a cap of twenty breeding dogs per operation, with a performance variance available for exceptional facilities meeting strict standards; variances are renewable annually while criteria are met, and variance holders are posted on the public registry. A statewide cap is authorized based on an objective workload-unit capacity formula with guardrails preventing arbitrary changes (sixty to ninety percent of inspector capacity), and counties must align their permit programs to the same methodology. Anti-evasion provisions prohibit rotation of dogs between licenses, and lease, lend, or foster-in-name-only arrangements designed to redistribute headcount are deemed rotations. Licensed operations are subject to mandatory unannounced inspections scaled by tier, with standardized evidence pack documentation that is presumptively admissible in enforcement proceedings. Inspections result in letter grades (A, B, C, or D) that are posted on premises and in the public registry; a grade of D triggers mandatory reinspection within thirty days. Inspectors shall utilize a standardized behavioral assessment protocol (Green, Yellow, Red) to evaluate animal welfare outcomes; for the first two years, behavioral assessments are used for data collection and education only, with corrective action plan requirements beginning in the third year if more than twenty-five percent of dogs score Red. Inspectors must be trained and certified in standardized protocols, evidence capture, biosecurity, and humane handling. The bill establishes minimum standards for housing, care, veterinary attention, breeding frequency with veterinary exceptions for small breeds, lifetime litter limits, required staff training, veterinarian-only surgical procedures, and written retirement and rehoming plans. Tier 2 and Tier 3 licensees must implement a written behavioral wellness plan approved by an independent attending veterinarian, providing for regular positive human interaction beyond routine husbandry, age-appropriate socialization during the critical period within biosecurity limits, environmental enrichment addressing social, nutritional, and physical needs, avoidance of flooding, and protocols for addressing behavioral concerns. The attending veterinarian must have no ownership interest in the operation and must conduct annual in-person site visits. Tier 1 licensees maintaining dogs within a residential dwelling as household companions are exempt from daily enrichment logs and written socialization checklists, provided dogs are housed inside the dwelling and the licensee has no employees and operates no facility open to the public. Dogs must be microchipped before transfer with chain-of-custody documentation, data privacy protections, retention limits, and breach notification within ten days with penalties for failure to notify. Any dog impounded and reclaimed must be microchipped before release at owner expense (not to exceed twenty-five dollars). Dogs impounded a third time within twenty-four months must be spayed or neutered before release (not to exceed one hundred fifty dollars), unless the owner holds a breeding license or intact permit. Quarterly photo inventories of breeding dogs and housing areas are required. Puppies cannot be transferred before eight weeks of age. Health disclosures must be provided at least twenty-four hours before transfer with a waiver option for on-site purchases. At transfer, the licensee must provide a behavioral disclosure including socialization exposures completed, observed behavioral concerns, and recommendations for continued socialization; failure to disclose material behavioral concerns is an unfair or deceptive act triggering buyer remedies. Predatory lease-to-own and high-interest financing arrangements for dog purchases are prohibited, and transfers financed through prohibited arrangements are voidable with full refund. Transfers in parking lots, flea markets, swap meets, and other unauthorized locations are serious violations authorizing immediate stop-work orders, with an exception for pre-arranged transfers at designated safe exchange zones at law enforcement facilities or video-monitored public locations. Marketplace platforms and retail sellers must verify license numbers before permitting listings, display verified information, and remove invalid listings within twenty-four hours; failure to verify is a separate per-listing violation, and platforms with ten or more unverified listings in thirty days face an additional $25,000 penalty. Advertisements must include breeder license numbers and microchip numbers for traceability. QR codes must be department-generated and secure to prevent spoofing. Out-of-state sellers to West Virginia consumers are subject to this article with venue in Kanawha County, the purchaser's county, or the county where the dog was delivered. Transporters must register, maintain manifests, and comply with rest requirements: six-hour maximum continuous transport with thirty-minute rest stops, twelve-hour maximum daily transport. Transport is prohibited when ambient heat index exceeds 90 degrees or wind chill is below 20 degrees unless a veterinarian provides written authorization. Temperature and humidity logs must be maintained for thirty days. Violations are classified as minor, moderate, or serious. Consumer remedies are provided for hereditary, congenital, infectious, and undisclosed behavioral conditions discovered after purchase, with a three-day veterinary examination requirement; transfers through prohibited financing are voidable with full refund. Purchasers have a private right of action with statutory damages and a three-year limitations period for concealed violations; remedies are cumulative with consumer protection law. The bill creates an escalating penalty structure with per-dog and per-day penalties for serious violations, per-listing penalties for marketplace violations, and criminal penalties including felony charges for repeat offenders, animal cruelty, and falsification of records, with authority for cumulative charging under animal cruelty statutes. Cost-of-care bond and escrow requirements apply to seizure cases, with a minimum bond of fifteen dollars per dog per day, custodial agency immunity, and courts may issue emergency ex parte impound orders based on veterinarian affidavits. A self-funding enforcement mechanism is established through the Canine Welfare Enforcement Fund, which receives license fees, civil penalties, per-puppy transfer fees, and transporter registration fees. Beginning in the third fiscal year, at least fifteen percent of fund inflows must be distributed as grants for county-administered spay and neuter programs, microchip assistance, and public education; counties must issue permits, conduct inspections, and maintain dashboards to be eligible. Grant distributions are fifty percent base allocation and fifty percent performance-based. Beginning in the second fiscal year, at least ten percent of fund inflows must be allocated for rural shelter development grants to counties lacking dedicated facilities, forming joint authorities, or upgrading to meet intake scanning and digital notice requirements. The department must purchase and distribute universal microchip scanners to all county facilities at no cost. Rules must be proposed within one hundred eighty days and finalized within twelve months; rules cannot reduce welfare protections below statutory baselines, and the department must publish model templates for behavioral wellness plans, enrichment logs, socialization checklists, and behavioral disclosure forms within one hundred eighty days. The bill creates a public breeder and transporter registry with inspection grades and aggregate behavioral assessment data beginning in year three. The public dashboard is updated monthly by the fifteenth with downloadable data files for transparency. Privacy protections shield exact residential addresses of Tier 1 licensees and purchaser personally identifiable information. Whistleblower protections include veterinarian immunity, voiding of contrary nondisclosure agreements, and rewards of up to fifteen percent of collected penalties. County coordination mechanisms include fixed twenty-five percent penalty sharing. This article establishes a minimum floor, not a ceiling; local governments may adopt more protective standards, and where conflicts exist, the provision providing greater protection for animal welfare applies. The article supplements the dog warden statutes, with digital notice requirements in addition to courthouse posting, and the fourteen-day harboring definition supersedes shorter county ordinances. No county may define harboring using a period shorter than fourteen days or impose surrender fees on qualifying finders. The Attorney General has explicit authority to bring civil actions for violations. An advisory committee meets semiannually to provide recommendations. Beginning one year after the effective date, the department must collect and publish annual data correlating licensed breeder output by breed category with shelter intake by breed category, including reunification metrics showing percentage of impounded dogs reunited with owners, percentage scanned for microchips at intake, average length of stay, and dogs received from finders versus at-large seizures; shelters and county agencies must report data or lose grant eligibility. The annual report must include methods disclosure, confidence intervals, and specification of whether correlations support causal inferences. Every animal control facility, shelter, pound, or agency receiving impounded or surrendered dogs must scan each animal for a microchip immediately upon intake using a universal scanner; if a microchip with valid contact information is detected, the facility must attempt to contact the owner within twenty-four hours and hold the animal for ten days before disposition. Facilities must post a photograph, description, and intake location of each impounded animal on a publicly accessible website or social media platform within twenty-four hours of intake. The department shall establish a statewide online database aggregating impounded animal postings from county facilities. Deceased animals must be scanned to facilitate owner notification. A finder who provides temporary care to a stray dog is protected by a fourteen-day safe harbor during which they are not deemed the owner or harborer, provided they make reasonable efforts to locate the owner, report the animal within seventy-two hours, and do not hold the animal out as their own. Animals presented by qualifying finders must be classified as strays, not owner surrenders, and no surrender fee may be charged. Finders are protected from liability for licensing fees, civil damages arising from reasonable care, and shelter surrender fees. A finder providing emergency veterinary care may seek reimbursement from the owner up to five hundred dollars upon reunification. No person may tether a dog for more than ten hours in any twenty-four-hour period. Tethering is prohibited during heat advisories, severe weather warnings, temperatures above ninety or below thirty-two degrees Fahrenheit, active precipitation that saturates the coat, or conditions posing health risk for more than thirty minutes. When tethering is permitted, the tether must be at least ten feet or five times the dog's length, must not be attached to a choke or prong collar, the dog must have access to food, water, and shelter, and the tether must not reach public areas or become entangled. Tethering is prohibited for dogs under six months, females in estrus or nursing, sick or injured dogs unless prescribed by a veterinarian, multiple dogs to the same point, and using chains weighing more than one-eighth the dog's weight. Exemptions apply for tethering under one hour while owner is present and within sight, veterinary care, camping or recreation while owner is present and attentive, working dogs actively engaged in agricultural tasks under supervision, and public events not exceeding two hours. Violations are minor for first offense, moderate for second within twelve months, and serious for third or subsequent within twenty-four months or any violation causing serious injury or death. Two or more counties may establish a joint animal control authority by agreement of their county commissions to provide consolidated sheltering and enforcement, operate shared facilities, employ officers with jurisdiction throughout member counties, pool revenues, apply jointly for grants with priority consideration, establish uniform ordinances, contract with humane societies, and coordinate with the department on licensing. The agreement must specify governance, cost allocation, facilities, personnel policies, withdrawal procedures, and dispute resolution. The department must provide technical assistance, prioritize grant funding for joint authorities, offer training, and publish a model joint authority agreement within one year. A transition period allows existing breeders to come into compliance with expansion limitations. The article includes a severability clause and shall be liberally construed to effectuate its protective purposes.
